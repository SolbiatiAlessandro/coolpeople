## WHAT IS THIS
Generic purpose collection of cool people, organized by category
let's try to follow a format, the more obvious who is the person the less explaination needed

Cool Person:
- < Name> (< Title>)
- < description>
- < links>

Some ideas:
1. let's put a coolnes rate next to each other, rigorously in the same format so that later we can parse and make queries
2. we can add interview/video/podcasts links under the person when we find them
